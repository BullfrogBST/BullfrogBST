Hi, I'm BullfrogBST, Bullfrog Studio, or just Bullfrog. I am interested in software development, web development, and most of all, computer engineering. I am learning JavaScript and I'm going to learn REACT and Rust. I'm about to be a freshman, and I will soon present myself with opportunities to study engineering. I am looking to collaborate so I can help out, and also locate and expand my skillset. I would love to collaborate on personal projects and projects that I can see help a community. You can contact me at BullfrogBST@gmail.com to contact me.
